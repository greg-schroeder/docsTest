      Add a new Currency test case to Workspace and Add Bank account > Workspace Settings > General settings for Currency
      1. Connect a bank account to the workspace (if you don't have one already) (As in Add Bank Account tests).
      2. Go to Workspace Settings > General Settings > Currency
      3. Verify that the default currency can't be edited and help text states why - 'The default currency can't be changed because this workspace is linked
          to a USD bank account.'

      placeholder: I decided on General Settings, I thought because the setting was
        here it made sense, but if you think it's better adding to the Add Bank
        Account tests, that's also fine by me.
